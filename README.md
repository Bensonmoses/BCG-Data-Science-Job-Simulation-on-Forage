# BCG-Data-Science-Job-Simulation-on-Forage

## Problem / Goal
The project aimed to tackle the issue of customer churn at XYZ Analytics by identifying key factors leading to churn and developing a predictive model to forecast future churn. This initiative was crucial for improving customer retention, enhancing satisfaction, and ensuring stable revenue growth.
Process / Solution

### Data Collection and Preprocessing: 
Utilizing Python, specifically Pandas and NumPy, for cleaning and preparing the data.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Visualization: 
Analyzing the data to identify trends and patterns related to churn.

### Model Development:
Engineering a Random Forest model, optimized for accuracy, which successfully predicted customer churn with 85% accuracy.

### Strategic Insights: 
Compiling the findings into an executive summary with actionable insights for reducing churn.

## Outcome
The project concluded with a significant achievementâ€”developing a highly accurate (85%) predictive model for customer churn. This model enabled XYZ Analytics to:

Gain a deeper understanding of the factors contributing to churn.
Make data-driven decisions to enhance customer retention strategies.
Equip the leadership with actionable insights for immediate and strategic interventions to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.

In summary, the project not only addressed the immediate challenge of predicting and reducing customer churn but also provided a strategic tool for XYZ Analytics to enhance long-term customer relationships and business stability.
